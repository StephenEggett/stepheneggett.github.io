        <p>
            Chameleons are popular reptile pets mostly imported from African countries like Madagascar, Tanzania, and Togo. The most common in the trade are the Senegal chameleon (<i class="taxonomy binomial">Chamaeleo senegalensis</i>), veiled chameleon (<i class="taxonomy binomial">Chamaeleo calyptratus</i>), panther chameleon (<i class="taxonomy binomial">Furcifer pardalis</i>), and Jacksonâ€™s chameleon (<i class="taxonomy binomial">Trioceros jacksonii</i>). The U.S. has been the main importer of chameleons since the early 1980s accounting for 69% of African reptile exports. However, there have been large declines due to tougher regulations to protect species from being taken from the wild and due to many becoming invasive in places like Florida. They have remained popular though which may be due to the captive-breeding in the U.S. which has increased to the point that the U.S. can fulfill its own demand, and has now even become a major exporter as well. In the U.S. they are so popular, that despite Florida having six invasive chameleon species due to the pet trade, reptile hobbyists in these areas search for chameleons to keep as pets or to breed and sell them, with some selling for up to a thousand dollars.
