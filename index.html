        Chameleons are distinguished by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dactyly#Zygodactyly">zygodactylous</a> feet; their swaying gait; and crests or horns on their brow and snout. Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereopsis">stereoscopic vision</a>.
